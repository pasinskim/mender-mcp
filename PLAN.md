# Mender MCP Server Development Plan

## Overview

This document outlines the development plan for a Model Context Protocol (MCP) server that integrates with Mender.io IoT platform. The server will enable AI assistants like Claude Code to interact with Mender services for device management, deployment tracking, and system monitoring.

## Project Goals

- **Primary**: Enable AI assistants to check device status and deployment information from Mender
- **Secondary**: Provide comprehensive IoT device management capabilities through natural language
- **Integration**: Seamless integration with Claude Code similar to existing Git and Jira MCP servers

## Research Insights

### MCP Server Patterns (from modelcontextprotocol/servers)
- **Modular Architecture**: Each server focuses on specific domain functionality
- **Standardized SDK Usage**: Python, TypeScript, and other language SDKs provide consistent implementation patterns
- **Authentication**: Secure, controlled access with configurable authentication mechanisms
- **Resource & Tool Separation**: Clear distinction between data resources and actionable tools

### Mender API Capabilities
- **Device Management**: Device inventory, status monitoring, configuration management
- **Deployment Operations**: Artifact management, deployment creation/tracking, rollback capabilities
- **Authentication**: JWT tokens, Personal Access Tokens, SSO/SAML support
- **Multi-API Structure**: Device APIs, Management APIs, Internal APIs

## Technical Architecture

### Technology Stack
- **Language**: Python (leveraging official MCP Python SDK)
- **Protocol**: Model Context Protocol (MCP) specification
- **Integration**: Mender Management APIs
- **Transport**: Standard I/O (stdio) for Claude Code integration

### Core Components

#### 1. Authentication Manager

## API Integration Details

### Authentication Flow
1. **Personal Access Token (PAT)**: Primary authentication method
2. **JWT Session Management**: For extended operations
3. **Multi-instance Support**: Handle multiple Mender deployments

### Key Endpoints to Integrate
```
Device Management:
- GET /api/management/v2/devauth/devices
- GET /api/management/v2/devauth/devices/{id}
- PUT /api/management/v2/devauth/devices/{id}/status

Deployment Management:
- GET /api/management/v1/deployments/deployments
- POST /api/management/v1/deployments/deployments
- GET /api/management/v1/deployments/deployments/{id}
- PUT /api/management/v1/deployments/deployments/{id}/status

Artifact Management:
- GET /api/management/v1/deployments/artifacts
- POST /api/management/v1/deployments/artifacts
```

### Data Models
```python
Device:
- id, name, status, last_checkin
- device_type, artifacts_installed
- authentication_status, group_membership

Deployment:
- id, name, artifact_name, status
- created, finished, device_count
- statistics (success, failure, pending)
- target_devices, device_groups

Artifact:
- id, name, description, size
- device_types_compatible, created
- download_url, checksum
```

## Configuration

### MCP Server Configuration
```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "mender": {
      "command": "mender-mcp-server",
      "args": [
        "--server-url", "https://hosted.mender.io",
        "--token-file", "~/.mender/token"
      ]
    }
  }
}
```

### Environment Variables
```bash
MENDER_SERVER_URL=https://hosted.mender.io
MENDER_ACCESS_TOKEN=<personal_access_token>

## Security Considerations

- **Token Security**: Secure handling of Personal Access Tokens
- **API Rate Limiting**: Respect Mender API limits
- **Input Validation**: Sanitize all user inputs
- **Error Information**: Avoid exposing sensitive data in errors
- **Network Security**: HTTPS-only communication

## Success Metrics
